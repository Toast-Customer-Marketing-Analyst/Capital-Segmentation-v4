# Capital-Segmentation-v4

This repo contains the SQL query pulling the dataset with all the customers, leads, MQLs, opps, deals, and segments. In this particular version, I filtered out all opps created before April 1, 2019 (before Capital was ramped). The timeline of the dataset is April 2019 to February 2020. 

It also contains the python script where the analysis was built and key visualizations/findings.
