# Capital-Segmentation-v4

This project was effort to identify which audience segments who are eligible for Toast Capital (funding product for restaurants) were historically more likely to convert. The conversion metrics included are % of eligible leads that requested funding (MQLs), % of MQLs that got a final offer (Opportunities), and % of Opps that signed their offer (Deals). The full list of attributes defining the audience segments and their respective conversion results can be viewed in the Jupyter Notebook.

This repo contains the SQL query pulling the dataset with all the customers, leads, MQLs, opps, deals, and segments. In this particular version, I filtered out all opps created before April 1, 2019 (before Capital was ramped). The timeline of the dataset is April 2019 to February 2020. 

It also contains the python script where the analysis was built and key visualizations/findings.
